# Exploring Ebay Car Sales Data

worked with a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section of the German eBay website.

The dataset was originally scraped and uploaded to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/orgesleka/used-cars-database/data) but we're only using a sample of 50000 of the full dataset.

In this project we have cleaned the dataset and analyzed the included used car listings.
